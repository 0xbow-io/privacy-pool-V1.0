# Privacy Pool V1.0 Smart Contracts (Solidity)

Privacy Pool V1.0 is a protocol designed for confidential data operations with the EVM.

> [!CAUTION] Privacy Pool V1.0 Contracts has not been audited. Please use with caution.

# Overview

Privacy Pool V1.0 is a protocol designed for confidential data operations with the EVM by leveraging zero-knowledge friendly cryptographic techniques.
It is a small set of smart contracts that allow users to confidentially store or share data with minimum complexity.

## Supported Operations

Privacy Pool V1.0 supports the following operations:

1. **Commitment**: Utilise zero-knoweldge circuits to compute up to 2 252-bit fEs that is encrypted and comitted to (stored in) a privacy pool.
2. **Release**: Release fEs from a domain to a sink address.
3. **Proof of Association**: Generate a proof that a set fEs is the output of multiple computations over a set of fEs with properties that satisfy predicates defined by an Association Set Provider (**ASP**).

For Privacy Pool to confidentially store data the following constraints must be satisfied:

1. A set of elements must exist that can prove sufficient **ownership** of fEs.
   1. i.e. a set of **cryptographic keys** which can encrypt / decrypt / sign the fE and proves fE **ownership** by embedding a shared secret into the data.
2. fEs are preserved in some form / representation that enables **confidential computation** over its properties / traits / value.
   1. i.e. fE is encrypted using zero-knowledge friendly cryptographic techniques supporting verifiable & confidential data operations.
3. The Existence of the fE in some domain can be confidentially proven:
   1. The domain can be characterized as a structured set, where it's elements hold sufficient membership proofs (i.e. Merkle Tree inclusion proofs) and are the only valid inputs to field-element arithmetic functions. These functions are implemented as zero-knowledge arithmetic circuits to preserve data privacy.
   2. Consider a **Privacy Pool** instance as a domain
4. Applying set-filter functions (i.e, predicates) over data sets must be privacy-preserving.
   1. i.e. Ability to iterate through data and generate a subset that satisfy predicates without revealing the data that were excluded or included in the subset through application of zero-knowledge folding scheme's (i.e. Nova).
   2. [!NOTE] With Privacy Pool V1.0 users can generate a "proof of association" **PoA** which confidentially verify that a data set is the latest output of a chain of data operations where all inputs & outputs satisfy predicates defined by an Association Set Provider (**ASP**).

## Data Types

V1.0 operates on 252-bit polymorphic field-elements (fE) that can encode various data types (i.e. encoded secret, storage pointers, data hashes, etc).
fEs are preserved in a Poseidon Cipher (c) that is generated from a commitment tuple (v, s, k) where:

- v is the 252-bit value to be stored.
- s is the domain identifier.
- k is the ECDH shared secret key derived from a EdDSA key-pair.

The Poseidon Cipher is a 7-element array that is encrypted with a shared secret key (eK) derived from a randomly generated salt key (Salt) and the public-key (Pk) of an EdDSA key-pair.

## What is a Commitment?

Privacy Pool V1.0 employs a commitment scheme that binds a 252-bit field element to a domain and a cryptographic key-pair forming a commitment tuple: (value, scope, secret).

- **Value**: The 252-bit value to be stored.
- **Scope** is the identifier of the domain.
  - In Privacy Pool V1.0, it is calculated as the Keccak256 Hash of chain ID & pool address & other parameters specific to the pool (i.e. number of elements in a cipher-text).
- Consider that a value bound to one domain/scope cannot exists in another domain.
- **Secret**: A ECDH shared secret key only known to the Key-pair.
  - Borrowing from PSE projects such as MACI, Semaphore, Privacy Pool V1.0 utilises the @zk-kit/eddsa-posiedon library to generate EdDSA keys that are compatible with the BabyJub curve ([@zk-kit/eddsa-posiedon](https://zkkit.pse.dev/modules/_zk_kit_eddsa_poseidon.html) library).
  - The secret within the commitment tuple is an Elliptic-Curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) shared key derived from a EdDSA key-pair (scalar multiplication with the public-key as the base)

The hash of the commitment tuple (**cHash**) is the Poseidon Hash of the tuple elements: Hash(value, scope, secret).
A **cipher** is generated from the **commitment** tuple via Poseidon encryption ([@zk-kit/poseidon-cipher](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit/tree/c9656231487e5a3cc86ac1941e79706fada011d4/packages/poseidon-cipher) library):

- A randomly generated **Salt** key is paired with the public-key (**Pk**) of an EdDSA Key-pair to derive the ECDH shared **encryption key** (**eK**) used for encrypting the **commitment** tuple.
- EdDSA public-key of the **Salt** is also created ( **saltPubKey**).
- Both **Salt** & **eK** should be discarded after encryption. As it's possible to recover the  **eK** by pairing the **saltPubKey** with the private-key (**pK**) of the same EdDSA Key-pair.
- By default, the **cipher** should contain 7 elements.

A commitment root **cRoot** is the merkle-root computed from a binary Merkle Tree constructed with the 7 **cipher** elements & **cHash** as the leaf layer (total 8 leaf nodes). The **cRoot** is inserted as a leaf into the sate tree (see next section).

```bash
/** from domain/commitment.circom line 160 **/

   ComputeTreeRoot(3)(
      [
      ciphertext[0], ciphertext[1],
      ciphertext[2], ciphertext[3],
      ciphertext[4], ciphertext[5],
      ciphertext[6], hash
   ]);
```

A null root (**nullRoot**) is the merkle-root computed from a binary Merkle Tree constructed with the secrets associated with the commitment (**Pk**, **saltPubKey**, **eK**, **Secret**) as the leaf layer (total 8 leaf nodes).

```bash
/** from domain/commitment.circom line 130 **/

   nullRoot <== ComputeTreeRoot(3)(
   [
      publicKey[0], publicKey[1],
      secretKey[0], secretKey[1],
      saltPublicKey[0], saltPublicKey[1],
      encryptionKey[0], encryptionKey[1]
   ]);
```

The **nullRoot** is also inserted as a leaf in the state tree  as  the **nullRoot** functions as a nullifier for **cRoot**. This prevents field-element operations to operate on the same element twice (also known as double spending).
